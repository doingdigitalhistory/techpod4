    <h2>Twain’s Legacy of Critique</h2>
    <p>Mark Twain’s works consistently expose hypocrisy in morality, law, and social norms. From the playful satire of <em>Tom Sawyer</em> to the moral outrage of <em>Lyncherdom</em>, Twain challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths about society. His critique remains relevant as modern cultures continue to wrestle with contradictions between ideals and actions.</p>

    <h3>Why It Still Matters</h3>
    <p>Hypocrisy is not a relic of the past—it persists in politics, social justice, and global relations. Twain’s insights remind us to look beyond appearances and demand integrity in both personal and public life. His writings encourage critical thinking and moral courage, qualities that are essential today.</p>

    <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
    <p>Twain’s voice resonates because it speaks to universal human flaws. By studying his works, we gain tools to recognize hypocrisy and strive for authenticity. His humor and honesty remain a powerful antidote to complacency and moral compromise.</p>
