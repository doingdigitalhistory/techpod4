    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mark Twain, one of America’s most celebrated authors, was not only a humorist but also a sharp social critic. His works reveal a deep disdain for hypocrisy in society, politics, and morality. Through satire and biting commentary, Twain exposes contradictions between ideals and actions, challenging readers to question authority and cultural norms.</p>

    <h2>Our Argument</h2>
    <p>The primary sources of Mark Twain show his dislike for hypocrisy, which he demonstrates in his writings. In <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>, adults preach virtue but reward misbehavior—a theme echoed in <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, where “civilized” society upholds slavery. Later essays like <em>To the Person Sitting in the Darkness</em> and <em>The United States of Lyncherdom</em> expand this critique to imperialism and mob violence, revealing Twain’s evolution from satire to moral outrage.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Twain’s critique is timeless. Hypocrisy still shapes modern politics, social norms, and global relations. Understanding Twain’s perspective helps us reflect on our own society and the contradictions we tolerate today.</p>
