    <p>
        Mark Twain, born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835, is one of America’s most influential authors and humorists. His works combine storytelling with sharp social critique, using satire to expose hypocrisy in society, politics, and morality. Twain’s writing reflects his belief that human nature often falls short of its ideals, and he uses humor and irony to challenge readers to think critically about cultural norms.

    <h2>Our Argument</h2>
    <p>
        Twain’s writings consistently reveal his disdain for hypocrisy. In <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>, adults preach virtue but reward misbehavior, highlighting the gap between moral ideals and reality. In <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, Twain critiques a society that calls itself “civilized” while perpetuating slavery. Huck’s internal struggle over helping Jim illustrates the conflict between societal norms and genuine morality.

        Twain’s later essays, such as <em>To the Person Sitting in the Darkness</em> and <em>The United States of Lyncherdom</em>, expand his critique beyond small-town life to global politics and systemic injustice. These works condemn Western imperialism and mob violence, exposing the hypocrisy of nations that claim to champion freedom and justice while committing acts of exploitation and brutality.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        Twain’s critique remains relevant today. Hypocrisy still shapes modern politics, social norms, and global relations. Understanding Twain’s perspective helps us reflect on our own society and the contradictions we tolerate. His writings encourage us to question authority, challenge cultural norms, and strive for authenticity in a world often dominated by appearances and contradictions.
